=== FILE MAP ===
src/shared/Constants.luau — all tuning values. Sections: BASE_COSTS, ROLE_DEFINITIONS, THEFT_SETTINGS, BUILDING (incl. BaseBuildTimeSeconds), SCALING, MAINTENANCE, WAVES (incl. FirstWaveDelaySeconds, SwarmDurationSeconds), COMBAT, ECONOMY, STORM, SCRAP_SPAWNS, TITAN
src/shared/Types.luau — Luau types: RoleName, BuildingType, RoleDefinition, TheftData, LegacyBuff, PurchaseResponse, BlueprintData (incl. rotation), ResourceType, SessionStats
src/shared/Remotes.luau — remote registry. Server creates, client waits. Names map at top. Remotes.Get() returns typed table. Includes SwarmEnded, BuildProgress.
src/shared/TheftComponent.luau — reusable dismantle progress tracker. Attach(part), StartDismantle(part, rat), ConnectCompleted(cb)
src/shared/Utils.luau — SnapToGrid(pos,gridSize), RemoveToolByName(player,name)
src/shared/AudioManifest.luau — centralized sound asset IDs. Keys: ShotgunFire, EnemyDeath, BuildPlace, BuildDestroy, RepairHiss, RepairClank, StormWind, StormRattle, WaveHorn, StageComplete, UIClick, MinigameSuccess, MinigameFail, AmbientBase, LootCollect
src/server/init.server.luau — bootstrap. Init order: PlayerTracking->Economy->Building->Resource->Objective->Role->Enemy->Storm->ScrapSpawn->Debug. All pcall-wrapped.
src/server/RemoteGuard.luau — rate limiter. Register(name,maxCalls,windowSec), Check(name,player)->bool. Auto-cleanup on PlayerRemoving.
src/server/Services/PlayerTrackingService.luau — peak/current player count, legacy buff multipliers
src/server/Services/EconomyService.luau — team scrap pool, storm steel, exponential cost (GROWTH_RATE^count), death penalty (15%, 10s cooldown per player), DeductScrap/DeductStormSteel, GetTotalScrapGathered
src/server/Services/BuildingService.luau — blueprint placement->ghost->final building with rotation support. Turrets deal TurretDamage via Humanoid:TakeDamage. Drills rotate+emit. Overlap validation with rotated CFrame. builtCounts tracks/decrements. BuildingHP attr. GetBuildingsLost counter.
src/server/Services/ResourceService.luau — drill stability degradation, wrench repair minigame (server validates), pending repair timeout 10s
src/server/Services/ObjectiveService.luau — Titan core (center map), integrity drain when dismantled. ProximityPrompt deposit. Stage 1-4 costs from Constants.TITAN.Stages. CompleteStage deducts scrap+steel, repairs +25 integrity, updates visuals. Stage 4->startFinalStand (GameState="final_stand", hidden 240s timer). Victory if integrity>0 at timer end. BindableEvent: ConnectGameStateChanged(cb). RequestSessionStats lazy-requires Enemy/Building for stats.
src/server/Services/RoleService.luau — role lock after first selection. Scrapper/Fixer/Enforcer. Sets player attrs: Role, SpeedMult, RepairMult, DamageMult. Legacy buff from PlayerTrackingService.
src/server/Services/EnemyService.luau — wave spawning (BaseCount + wave*EnemiesPerWave * difficultyMult). 30s swarm timer per wave. Rats: HP-based (100hp standard, 200hp elite), state machine (approaching->dismantling->fleeing). RatState includes targetBuilding for retargeting. Cost*HP scoring for target selection. Smart retargeting: proportional flee + retargetRat(). Standard kill: 2-5 scrap. Thief kill: 2-5 + 50% refund bundle. HitEnemy: server-authoritative damage, Enforcer-only. Final Stand: elite rats every 3s. IsSwarmActive() exposed. retreatAllRats() on swarm end. First wave delay 180s.
src/server/Services/StormService.luau — storm every 450s, 20s duration. Defers if swarm active (lazy requires EnemyService). Tether pads with emergence animation (scale tween, staggered). Wind damage uses BuildingHP attr. Steel spawns during storm. PermanentStorm mode for Final Stand.
src/server/Services/ScrapSpawnService.luau — loose scrap piles every 15s, 3 per batch, 5 scrap each, 45s despawn, raycast-placed, .Touched pickup
src/server/Services/DebugService.luau — studio-only commands: SpawnWave, StartStorm, AddScrap
src/client/init.client.luau — bootstrap. Disables CoreGuiType.Backpack. Init order: BlueprintController->ToolController->VFXController->MainHUD. All pcall-wrapped.
src/client/UI/MainHUD.luau — HUD coordinator. Scrap display, storm steel, wave timer (hidden in Final Stand), role selection (cards), build toolbar (responsive, rotation hint outside UIListLayout), build progress bar (hold-E), dismantle bars (throttled, Fixer strobe), threat/storm/tether banners, debug panel, Titan progress panel (distance indicator), settings panel (volume sliders), tutorial hints. Delegates repair minigame to RepairMinigameUI, end screens to EndScreenUI.
src/client/UI/RepairMinigameUI.luau — extracted module. Show(drillPart, rootGui, remotes), Clear(). Self-contained needle-and-zone minigame.
src/client/UI/EndScreenUI.luau — extracted module. ShowGameOver, ShowVictory, ShowFinalStandBanner, ClearFinalStandBanner. Session stats builder.
src/client/Controllers/BlueprintController.luau — client ghost preview with rotation (R key). Hold-to-build: 3s base (Fixer 0.6x), RenderStepped progress, E release cancels, distance check 14 studs. ConnectBuildProgress(cb) for MainHUD.
src/client/Controllers/ToolController.luau — shotgun (Enforcer-only, server-authoritative damage, 3D positional sound, Humanoid.CameraOffset recoil) + wrench (Fixer-only).
src/client/Controllers/VFXController.luau — AudioManifest-driven. Object pool loot fountain. Dismantle sparks+wobble. Storm lighting (blur=3, soft tint). Build flash+sound. Enemy death particles+sound. Building destruction dust+debris+sound. Ambient music (intensity shifts on WaveStarted, fades on SwarmEnded). Ka-ching on scrap collection. Overclock glow (PointLight on IsOverclocked). Camera shake via Humanoid.CameraOffset.

=== AUDIO MANIFEST ===
ShotgunFire=12222216, EnemyDeath=12222076, BuildPlace=12222253, BuildDestroy=12222084
RepairHiss=9118823107, RepairClank=12222253, StormWind=9125347736, StormRattle=130797915

MinigameSuccess=12221984, MinigameFail=12222208, AmbientBase=9043887091, LootCollect=12221976

=== GAME STATE FLOW ===
"playing" -> player deposits enough -> "final_stand" (stage 4 complete) -> survive 240s -> "victory" OR integrity=0 -> "defeat"
GameState attr on TitanChassis model. BindableEvent in ObjectiveService signals EnemyService+StormService.
Swarm cycle: wave spawns -> 30s swarm -> retreatAllRats -> SwarmEnded -> interval timer -> next wave. Storm defers until swarm ends.

=== REMOTES ===
Functions: RequestEconomyState, RequestBuildCosts, UseWrench, FinishBlueprint, RequestSessionStats
Events: DebugCommand, PlaceBlueprint, BlueprintPlaced, BlueprintFinished, BuildingDismantled, HitEnemy, EnemyKilled, ThreatDetected, ScrapUpdated, StormSteelUpdated, StormStarted, StormEnded, TetherStatus, RoleSelected, WaveStarted, UpdateWaveTimer, GlobalGameOver, GlobalVictory, TitanStageCompleted, FinalStandStarted, RepairMinigameResult, DrillRepaired, SwarmEnded, BuildProgress

=== DEPENDENCY GRAPH (server) ===
init.server -> all services (requires at top, inits sequentially)
ObjectiveService -> Constants, Remotes, TheftComponent, EconomyService
EnemyService -> Constants, Remotes, TheftComponent, EconomyService, BuildingService, ObjectiveService, PlayerTrackingService, RemoteGuard
StormService -> Constants, Remotes, TweenService, EconomyService, BuildingService, PlayerTrackingService, ObjectiveService, EnemyService (lazy)
BuildingService -> Constants, Remotes, Types, TheftComponent, Utils, EconomyService, RemoteGuard
ResourceService -> Constants, Remotes, EconomyService, PlayerTrackingService, RemoteGuard
RoleService -> Constants, Remotes, Utils, PlayerTrackingService, RemoteGuard
ScrapSpawnService -> Constants, EconomyService
No circular deps. StormService lazy-requires EnemyService for IsSwarmActive. ObjectiveService lazy-requires EnemyService/BuildingService for stats.

=== DEPENDENCY GRAPH (client) ===
init.client -> BlueprintController, ToolController, VFXController, MainHUD
VFXController -> Constants, AudioManifest, Remotes, MainHUD
ToolController -> Constants, AudioManifest, Remotes, BlueprintController, MainHUD
MainHUD -> Constants, AudioManifest, Remotes, BlueprintController, RepairMinigameUI, EndScreenUI
BlueprintController -> Constants, Remotes, Utils
RepairMinigameUI -> Constants, AudioManifest (standalone)
EndScreenUI -> (standalone, remotes passed as param)

=== PHASE STATUS ===
Phase 1: DONE (12/12) — security, architecture, critical bugs
Phase 2: DONE (12/12) — combat, economy, enemies, core mechanics
Phase 3: DONE (8/8) — win condition, Titan stages, Final Stand, victory/defeat, stats
Phase 4: DONE (10/10) — AudioManifest, 3D shotgun sound, build/destroy sounds+VFX, enemy death particles+sound, UI sounds, ambient music, camera shake fix, loot fountain parallelized
Phase 5: DONE (11/11) — building rotation, MainHUD split, responsive layout, role descriptions, Fixer strobe, settings menu, tutorial hints, distance indicator, throttled dismantle bars
Refinement Phase 1: DONE (13/13) — balance tuning (InitialScrap 200, BaseCount 3, FirstWaveDelay 180s), swarm timer (30s + retreatAllRats), smart retargeting (proportional flee + retargetRat), Cost*HP targeting, storm blur 3 + soft tint + 20s duration, storm/swarm exclusion, tether emergence anim, hold-to-build (3s base, Fixer 0.6x), overclock glow, ka-ching, wave timer hidden in Final Stand, rotate hint fix, backpack UI disabled

=== KNOWN REMAINING ISSUES ===
- No persistence/save system (beyond scope — would need DataStoreService)
- Sound asset IDs in AudioManifest are from Roblox classic library; some may need replacement with custom uploads depending on Roblox audio policy
- Role selection currently locks on first choice — no re-selection UI
- DrillSmoke threshold at <20% stability — GDD says 0%, kept at 20% for better warning
